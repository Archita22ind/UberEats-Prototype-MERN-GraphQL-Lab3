The is a prototype of the famous UberEats application, an online portal for food delivery or pickup
across varied locations throughout the world. Since, this application is just a prototype, it mainly
highlights the below functionalities-

1. A customer signs up on the application, creates user login, selects food items from a particular
restaurant he/she wishes to order from, specifies a delivery or pickup mode, and places an
order.
2. The restaurant owner also has a user account managing the restaurant profile, food menu,
delivery systems, etc. accepts the order from the customer.
3. The life cycle of the order from ordered, being prepared at the restaurant till the time it is
delivered, or pickup is updated by the restaurant and tracked by the customer.
4. Restaurants fulfill the order and sign it off to a delivery person.
5. Either the order is picked up by the customer or delivered by a delivery person to the customer.
6. The application also gives the records of all the past orders to both the customers as well as
restaurant owners.
7. The customers are also able to record their profile details and a list of their favorite restaurants.

All the above main functionalities were incorporated by builiding a functional, user friendly and
responsive application.
